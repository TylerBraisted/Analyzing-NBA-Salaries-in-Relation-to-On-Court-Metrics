# Analyzing-NBA-Salaries-in-Relation-to-On-Court-Metrics

This repository contains a collaborative data analysis project, made by me and a fellow UMD student, where we set out to see the relationship between NBA player salaries and their on-court performance. By examining a csv dataset with detailed player statistics and salary information, we were able identify which players offer the most value relative to their earnings. 

This project is simultaneously meant to act as a tutorial for the entire data science pipeline, including:
  - Data Curation
  - Data Processing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizing Data
  - Hypothesis Testing and Machine Learning
  - Interpertation & Drawing Conclusions from Data
